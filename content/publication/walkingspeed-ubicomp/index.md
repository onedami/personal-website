abstract = "The mood of a community influences work productivity, socioeconomic outcomes and general quality of life of its members, so being able to measure it opens a wealth of opportunities like, informing policies, scheduling events and possibly discovering the contexts that bring about undesirable moods within a community. 
Though there are a plethora of methods for measuring emotional states of individuals in lab settings (e.g. self-report, analysis of nonverbal behaviours, physiological sensors), they do not scale well to large numbers of people or in-the-wild settings. This paper examines the feasibility of inferring the mood of a community by measuring the walking speed of pedestrians, which is a technique that is unobtrusive, scalable, and readily available. Our preliminary results from our data collection reveal differences in walking speed at different times of the day; demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. We discuss the implications of our findings, followed by the future steps of this work."
