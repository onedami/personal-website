# Biography

A PhD candidate in Human-Computer Interaction and affective computing. During the past 3 years, I researched on the use of pupillary response as a proxy to sense arousal, while also using eye-tracking technology to identify the userâ€™s focal attention during moments of increased arousal. Future research interests include the use of unobtrusive technologies for affect detection in naturalistic settings. 
Previously, I worked as a software consultant delivering Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions using SAP platform.
