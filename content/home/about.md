# Biography

Researcher in Human-Computer Interaction and affective computing. For my PhD, I researched on the use of pupillary response as a proxy to sense arousal, while also using eye-tracking technology to identify the userâ€™s focal attention during moments of increased arousal. Future research interests include the use of unobtrusive technologies for affect detection in naturalistic settings, the use of conversational voice interfaces in public spaces. 
I currently work as a software developer for Sage, and a visiting research fellow at the University of Manchester.
